This section shows how a metal/PEC is introduced into CSX. 

\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}\textbf{AddMetal}\end{large}}\\
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Syntax:\end{large}}

  \begin{lstlisting}
 CSX = AddMetal(CSX, name)
  \end{lstlisting}
  
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Description:\end{large}}\\
This function introduces perfect electric conductor of no loss into CSX.\\
\hyperref[para:CSX]{\texttt{CSX}} 
 \begin{myindentpar}\hyperref[para:CSX]{\texttt{CSX}} describes geometrical objects and their physical or non-physical properties in .xml file.
 \end{myindentpar} 
 \texttt{name} 
 \begin{myindentpar}{\texttt{name}} is given by user and must be matched with that is mentioned in the syntax for defining CSXprimitives~\ref{CSXprimitives}.  
 \end{myindentpar} 

 If a lossy conducting material is preferred,then the following function is recommended:  
 
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}\textbf{AddConductingSheet}\end{large}}\\

\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Syntax:\end{large}}

  \begin{lstlisting}
CSX = AddConductingSheet(CSX, name, conductivity, thickness)
  \end{lstlisting}
  
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Description:\end{large}}\\ 
\hyperref[para:CSX]{\texttt{CSX}} 
 \begin{myindentpar}\hyperref[para:CSX]{\texttt{CSX}} describes geometrical objects and their physical or non-physical properties in .xml file.
 \end{myindentpar} 
 \texttt{name} 
 \begin{myindentpar}{\texttt{name}} is given by user and must be matched with that is mentioned in the syntax for defining CSXprimitives\ref{CSXprimitives}.  
 \end{myindentpar} 
 \texttt{conductivity} 
 \begin{myindentpar} It is given by user according to the conductivity of metal being used. The most frequent used metal is copper and its conductivity is 58e6$Sm^{-1}$.    
 \end{myindentpar}
 \texttt{thickness} 
 \begin{myindentpar} it defines the thickness of metal sheet.     
 \end{myindentpar}

\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Examples:\end{large}}\\  

\begin{lstlisting} 
CSX = AddMetal(CSX,'metal'); 
\end{lstlisting}

This syntax adds PEC material into CSX with the name 'metal'. 

\begin{lstlisting} 
CSX = AddConductingSheet(CSX,'copper',56e6,70e-6);
\end{lstlisting}

This syntax adds a conducting sheet of 70$\mu$m into CSX. The assigned metal is named copper and has conductivity of 58e6$Sm^{-1}$.
